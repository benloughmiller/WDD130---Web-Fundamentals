    <p>
        The skin of an orange is where most of the vitamin C is contained, so if you rub orange peels on your skin, it can help heal your skin.
        This tip is great for people with acne-prone or oily skin.

    <h1>TURN ORANGES INTO CLEANER</h1>
    <p>
        he natural oils in orange peels are a great natural cleaner.
        If you put the peels in a jar of vinegar for two weeks then strain the liquid, you will be left with a great smelling cleaner.
        This cleaner is especially great for cleaning sticker residue, since orange peels have natural oils that work on grime.

    <h1>SUPPORT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM</h1>
    <p>
        One medium orange can provide nearly all your recommended daily vitamin C intake.
        Vitamin C supports the immune system, reduces inflammation, and helps your body perform its basic functions.
        It also helps your body absorb iron, which is an essential nutrient.
