    <h1>CHOOSE YOUR ORANGE</h1>
    <p>
        First, you need to find which kind of oranges you want. Consider factors such as climate suitability, size of the tree, and desired fruit characteristics.
        If you live in a colder climate, you should look for an orange variety that grows well in the cold.
        The top five most popular oranges are: 1. Navel, 2. Blood orange, 3. Cara Cara, 4. Mandarin, 5. Tangerine.
    </p>

    <h1>GROWING CONDITIONS</h1>
    <p>
        Most oranges grow best in subtropical climates. They require full sun exposure for at least 6 hours per day and prefer soil that drains well and is slightly acidic.
        If the soil you are planting into is overly sandy or clay-based, it is recommended to supplement your soil with organic material.
    </p>

    <h1>PLANTING</h1>
    <p>
        Spring is the ideal time to plant orange trees. Follow these steps for successful planting: 1. Dig a hole twice the size of the roots and loosen the soil at the bottom.
        2. Place the tree in the hole, ensuring the lump at the base is above the soil line. 3. Fill the hole with soil, gently firming it around the roots.
        4. Create a water basin around the tree, a few inches away from the trunk to facilitate irrigation.

        <h1>WATERING</h1>
        <p>
            Regular watering is essential for the success of your orange tree.
            Deep watering (allowing the water to soak in deep into the soil) once a week is usually sufficient but can be adjusted based on the climate.

    <h1>PRUNING AND HARVESTING</h1>
    <p>
        Pruning helps maintain the shape and size of your orange tree while promoting air circulation and sunlight penetration.
        Remove dead, damaged, or crossing branches. Generally, oranges are ready for picking 9-12 months after flowering, but the timing of orange harvest can vary depending on the variety and climate.
        They should be fully colored, feel firm, and have a sweet fragrance. Enjoy!
