    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Ben. I'm from Crestview Florida, and I'm majoring in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>My career path is IT, and when I'm not doing classwork, I'm working remotely as an IT worker. I'm excited to use this class to increase my knowledge of web development</p>
    <p>When I'm finished with work and school for the day, I have a variety of hobbies that I like to do, such as fishing, soldering, and reading. </p>
