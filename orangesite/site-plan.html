      <p>Oranges are a delicious fruit that are healthy and great sources of Vitamin C. Oranges have a wide range of uses and some may surprise you! Oranges are praised for their sweet taste and the amount of vitamin C they contain. Vitamin C is a great immune system booster and has been linked to reduce the risk of illness, from common colds to cancer. If you would like to learn more about the uses and health benefits of oranges, navigate to our Orange Uses information page.
      </p>
<p>UNITED STATES ORANGE CONSUMPTION 
  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimated in 2000 that the average American consumes 13-15 pounds of oranges per year, and up to 75 pounds of Orange Juice. It is no wonder that oranges are among the most grown fruits in America. 
</p>
<p>ORANGE GROWING IN AMERICA
  Oranges grow best in subtropical environments, which is why the state of Florida alone accounts for more than 70% of all orange growing in America, followed by California and Texas. There are some varieties of oranges that grow well in colder environments. If you would like to learn more about growing oranges, go to our orange Growing Guide on this website.

      <h3>Uses For Oranges</h3>
      <p>
HELP YOUR SKIN
The skin of an orange is where most of the vitamin C is contained, so if you rub orange peels on your skin, it can help heal your skin. This tip is great for people with acne-prone or oily skin.
</p>
<p>
TURN ORANGES INTO CLEANER
The natural oils in orange peels are a great natural cleaner. If you put the peels in a jar of vinegar for two weeks, then strain the liquid, you will be left with a great smelling cleaner. This cleaner is especially great for cleaning sticker residue, since orange peels have natural oils that work on grime. 
</p>
<p>
CREATE HOME FRAGRANCE
Add some orange peels into a pot filled with water with additional ingredients such as a bit of vanilla or cinnamon. If you bring this mixture to a simmer, it will bring a great smell to your home. 
</p>
<p>
SUPPORT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
One medium orange can provide nearly all your recommended daily vitamin C intake. Vitamin C supports the immune system, reduces inflammation, and helps your body perform its basic functions. It also helps your body absorb iron, which is an essential nutrient.

      <h3>HOW TO GROW ORANGES</h3>
      <p>    
CHOOSE YOUR ORANGE
First, you need to find which kind of oranges you want. Consider factors such as climate suitability, size of the tree, and desired fruit characteristics. If you live in a colder climate, you should look for an orange variety that grows well in the cold. The top five most popular oranges are: 1. Navel, 2. Blood orange, 3. Cara Cara, 4. Mandarin, 5. Tangerine.
</p>
<p>
GROWING CONDITIONS
Most oranges grow best in subtropical climates. They require full sun exposure for at least 6 hours per day and prefer soil that drains well and is slightly acidic. If the soil you are planting into is overly sandy or clay-based, it is recommended to supplement your soil with organic material. 
</p>
<p>
PLANTING
Spring is the ideal time to plant orange trees. Follow these steps for successful planting: 1. Dig a hole twice the size of the roots and loosen the soil at the bottom. 2. Place the tree in the hole, ensuring the lump at the base is above the soil line. 3. Fill the hole with soil, gently firming it around the roots. 4. Create a water basin around the tree, a few inches away from the trunk, to facilitate irrigation.
</p>
<p>
WATERING
Regular watering is essential for the success of your orange tree. Deep watering (allowing the water to soak in deep into the soil) once a week is usually sufficient but can be adjusted based on the climate. 
</p>
<p>
PRUNING AND HARVESTING
Pruning helps maintain the shape and size of your orange tree while promoting air circulation and sunlight penetration. Remove dead, damaged, or crossing branches. Generally, oranges are ready for picking 9-12 months after flowering, but the timing of orange harvest can vary depending on the variety and climate. They should be fully colored, feel firm, and have a sweet fragrance. Enjoy!
