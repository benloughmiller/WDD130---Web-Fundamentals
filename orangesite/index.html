        <h1>UNITED STATES ORANGE CONSUMPTION</h1>
        <p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimated in 2000 that the average American consumes 13-15 pounds of oranges per year,
          and up to 75 pounds of Orange Juice. It is no wonder that oranges are among the most grown fruits in America.</p>

        <h1>ORANGE GROWING IN AMERICA</h1>
        <p>Oranges grow best in subtropical environments, which is why the state of Florida alone accounts for more than 70% of all orange growing in America,
          followed by California and Texas. There are some varieties of oranges that grow well in colder environments.
